Host: Welcome to episode 4 of our podcast series on optimizing dedicated SQL pools. I'm your host, Jill, and in this episode, we'll be discussing the importance of backup and recovery for your dedicated SQL pools.

Backing up your dedicated SQL pool is crucial for ensuring that your data is protected in the event of a disaster or unexpected failure. But how do you go about creating a backup and recovery plan for your dedicated SQL pool?

One of the first steps in creating a backup and recovery plan is to determine your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) and Recovery Time Objective (RTO). RPO refers to the point in time to which you need to be able to recover your data, while RTO refers to the amount of time it should take to recover your data.

Once you have a clear understanding of your RPO and RTO, you can then start creating your backup and recovery plan.

One common method for backing up dedicated SQL pools is through the use of database snapshots. This method allows you to quickly create a point-in-time copy of your database, which can then be used to restore your data in the event of a failure.

Another approach is to use log shipping. This method involves shipping transaction logs from the primary database to one or more secondary databases, which can then be used to perform a point-in-time recovery.

It's also important to consider disaster recovery, which involves creating a backup of your dedicated SQL pool in a separate location. This allows you to quickly restore your data in the event of a catastrophic failure at your primary location.
